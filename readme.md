# Spotify Clone

- This is a Spotify clone built with Vue3, Vite, Tailwind, and Pinia.

## Objective

My goal was to learn more about Vue.js and Vite. This was achieved by building a Spotify clone app, which served as a practical and hands-on way to explore key concepts and features of these technologies.

## Key Learnings

- **Vue.js:** Deepened my understanding of Vue.js by exploring components, directives, and the Vue Router for creating a seamless single-page application experience.

- **Vite:** Leveraged Vite's rapid development server, efficient hot module replacement, and optimized build performance for a smooth Vue.js development experience
